## [0.5.1] - 2025-06-08

### Fixed
- **Gateway Creation UI Reliability & Error Handling**:
    - Resolved misleading "Failed to create Gateway" UI error when the backend operation was successful. The UI now correctly reflects success for new or existing/unchanged Gateways.
    - Root cause: The frontend's `createGateway` helper (in `ui/src/helper/kubernetes.ts`) was misinterpreting the structure of success responses from the backend service. The `ddClient.extension.vm.service.post()` call wraps the backend's actual `APIResponse` (e.g., `{success: true, data: "..."}`) inside a top-level `data` property. The frontend helpers were expecting the `success` flag at the top level.
    - Fix:
        - Modified `callBackendAPI` in `ui/src/helper/kubernetes.ts` to return the raw response from `ddClient.extension.vm.service.post()` for successful HTTP operations. For errors it catches internally, it forms and returns a standard `APIResponse`-like object (`{ success: false, error: "details" }`).
        - Updated API helper functions (`createGateway`, `listHostContexts`, `createHTTPRoute`) to correctly inspect the structure of the response from `callBackendAPI`, checking if the `APIResponse` payload is the direct object or nested under a `.data` property, to accurately determine success.
        - Backend's `s.applyYAML` function (in `backend/main.go`) was also previously enhanced to correctly interpret `kubectl apply` output indicating "unchanged" or "configured" as success, even if `kubectl` returned a non-zero exit code.
- **Initial Gateway Creation Stability (Kubeconfig/Socket Hang up)**:
    - Resolved initial "socket hang up" errors during Gateway creation.
    - Root cause: Backend Go service crashes due to kubeconfig initialization issues (e.g., previous reliance on a hardcoded path, not failing fast if the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable was missing or invalid for the backend service).
    - Fix:
        - Backend's `ensureKubeconfig` function in `backend/main.go` now solely relies on the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and returns a clear error if it's not set or the config is unreadable. Hardcoded paths removed.
        - Backend's YAML application logic (`applyYAML`, `applyYAMLContent`) now fails fast and propagates errors if kubeconfig setup fails.
        - Frontend's `callBackendAPI` error extraction was improved to display more detailed error messages from the backend.
- **LoadBalancer Status and Configuration UI Enhancements**:
    - **Status Accuracy**: `checkLoadBalancerStatus` logic in `ui/src/services/loadBalancerService.ts` was made stricter. MetalLB is now considered "CONFIGURED" only if its `metallb-system` namespace exists, its controller deployment is ready, and at least one `IPAddressPool` is detected and reported. This resolved misleading "CONFIGURED" states when Gateways were failing with "AddressNotAssigned".
    - **TypeScript Build Error**: Fixed `TS2339: Property 'servicesWithIPs' does not exist on type 'LoadBalancerStatus'` by adding the `servicesWithIPs` property to the `LoadBalancerStatus` interface and ensuring the `checkLoadBalancerServices` method populates it.
    - **"Configure LoadBalancer" Button Visibility**: Corrected logic in `ui/src/components/LoadBalancerManager.tsx` so the button to configure MetalLB is displayed when the LoadBalancer status is "NOT CONFIGURED", even if an accompanying error message (like "MetalLB namespace not found") is also present.
    - **MetalLB Configuration Dialog Robustness**:
        - Mitigated JavaScript TypeErrors (e.g., ".includes is not a function") within `configureMetalLB` (`ui/src/services/loadBalancerService.ts`) by ensuring variables derived from backend responses are safely coerced to strings before string methods are called.
        - Improved parsing of responses from the backend's `/apply-yaml` endpoint within `configureMetalLB`. The frontend now correctly extracts nested error messages (e.g., from `response.data.error`) for more reliable keyword checks ("unchanged", "already exists").
        - Provided clearer user-facing error messages in the configuration dialog for ambiguous backend response patterns (e.g., when `Output` was `[object Object]`), guiding the user that the operation might have succeeded despite the reported hiccup.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-06-07

### Changed
- **Architectural Refinement for Kubernetes Interactions**:
    - Frontend services (`loadBalancerService.ts`, `githubTemplateService.ts`, `kubernetes.ts`) now primarily use the host's `kubectl` (via `ddClient.extension.host.cli.exec()`) for most direct Kubernetes operations (reading resources, status checks, applying URL-based manifests, `kubectl wait`). This significantly improves reliability by leveraging the host's Kubernetes context and avoiding VM-to-host API connectivity issues (e.g., `127.0.0.1` vs `host.docker.internal`).
    - The backend VM service's `/apply-yaml` endpoint is used for applying dynamically generated YAML strings (e.g., MetalLB `IPAddressPool` and `L2Advertisement`).
- **LoadBalancer Management (`loadBalancerService.ts`) Overhaul**:
    - All Kubernetes status detection calls (`quickCheckMetalLBNamespace`, `checkMetalLBStatus`, `checkCloudLoadBalancer`, `checkLoadBalancerServices`, `detectDockerNetworkRange`) refactored to use the host CLI for accuracy and reliability.
    - MetalLB installation (`configureMetalLB`):
        - Initial `metallb-native.yaml` manifest application now uses host CLI with `--validate=false` flag to bypass schema validation issues related to K8s API access from within the VM.
        - `kubectl wait` for MetalLB pods now uses host CLI.
    - MetalLB status detection (`checkMetalLBStatus`) logic refined: MetalLB is now considered fully "Configured" only if its controller deployment is ready *and* at least one `IPAddressPool` is detected.
- **GitHub Template Application (`githubTemplateService.ts`)**:
    - Switched from using the backend `/apply-template` endpoint to using the host's `kubectl` (via `ddClient.extension.host.cli.exec()`) for applying templates directly from URLs, enhancing reliability.

### Fixed
- **LoadBalancer Configuration Reliability**:
    - Resolved persistent "Failed to install MetalLB: exit status 1" errors by moving initial manifest application to host CLI with appropriate flags and refining logic for handling pre-existing installations.
    - Addressed "connection refused" errors encountered when the backend VM service attempted Kubernetes API calls (e.g., for manifest validation or applying resources) by shifting these operations to the host CLI where `127.0.0.1` correctly points to the K8s API.
- **LoadBalancer Status Accuracy**: UI now correctly reflects MetalLB status based on comprehensive host CLI checks, including the presence of `IPAddressPools`.
- **Template Application Reliability**: Resolved "connection refused" errors during template application by moving the operation to the host CLI.
- **Build Stability**: Corrected various TypeScript syntax errors in `loadBalancerService.ts` that were causing build failures.

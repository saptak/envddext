# Overview & Prerequisites

## 🏗️ Understanding the Foundation

### 🚪 What is an API Gateway?

**Think of an API Gateway as the "intelligent reception desk" for your digital services:**

```
🌐 [Client Apps] → 🏢 [API Gateway] → 🔧 [Microservices]
       ↓                ↓                ↓
   📱 Mobile App     🔐 Security      👤 User Service
   💻 Web App        🚦 Routing       🛒 Order Service
   🔌 Partner API    📊 Monitoring    💳 Payment Service
```

**🎯 Key Benefits:**
- **🎯 Single Entry Point**: One URL to manage all traffic
- **🛡️ Security Layer**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting
- **🔀 Smart Routing**: Path-based, header-based, method-based routing
- **📈 Observability**: Centralized logging, metrics, and tracing
- **⚡ Performance**: Caching, compression, load balancing
- **🔧 Service Protection**: Backend services hidden from direct access

### ⚡ Why Envoy Gateway?

**The evolution from legacy to modern:**

| 📊 Aspect | ❌ Legacy Ingress | ✅ Gateway API | 🚀 Envoy Gateway |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Routing** | Basic paths only | Rich HTTP matching | **Advanced traffic control** |
| **Security** | Basic TLS | Some policies | **Enterprise-grade policies** |
| **Traffic Control** | Limited | Basic splitting | **Canary, A/B, blue-green** |
| **Observability** | Minimal | Basic metrics | **Full tracing & monitoring** |
| **Extensibility** | Vendor-specific | Standardized | **Production-tested at scale** |

**🎯 Envoy Gateway Advantages:**
- 🎨 **Declarative**: YAML-based, GitOps-ready configuration
- 🏭 **Battle-Tested**: Powers Lyft, Uber, Netflix at massive scale
- 📊 **Observable**: Built-in metrics, tracing, and logging
- 🔌 **Extensible**: Custom filters and policies
- 🛡️ **Secure**: Comprehensive security policy framework

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

* Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled
* Minimum 4GB RAM allocated to Docker Desktop
* Envoy Gateway Docker Desktop Extension v0.12.2+ (Production Ready)

### New in v0.12.2 - Revolutionary Port Forward Manager

🚀 **Dynamic Service Discovery**: The new Port Forward Manager completely eliminates hardcoded service names and provides:

- **Intelligent Service Selector**: Professional dropdown showing all available LoadBalancer services with their types and ports
- **Cross-Namespace Discovery**: Automatically discover services across any namespace with instant switching
- **Zero Configuration**: No more typing service names or guessing ports - everything discovered dynamically
- **One-Click Gateway Access**: Instant setup with "Start Gateway Port Forward" button
- **Smart Port Management**: Automatic port conflict resolution and localhost URL generation

### Setup Verification

1. **Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop**:
   * Open Docker Desktop → Settings → Kubernetes
   * Check "Enable Kubernetes" and click "Apply & Restart"

2. **Install the Extension**:
   * Open Docker Desktop Extensions tab
   * Search for "Envoy Gateway" and install

3. **Verify Installation**:
   * Open the Envoy Gateway extension
   * You should see a clean 4-tab interface with Envoy branding:
     - **Quick Start**: Overview dashboard with dynamic deployment monitoring and enhanced template gallery
     - **Infrastructure**: Gateways, HTTP Routes, and TLS certificates
     - **Security & Policies**: Security policies and resilience configuration
     - **Traffic & Testing**: Traffic splitting, HTTP testing, and performance validation

## Learning Path

This guide is organized as a progressive learning journey:

1. **[Getting Started](./02-demo-01-first-gateway.md)** - Deploy your first gateway and understand basic concepts

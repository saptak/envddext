## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Go for VM service backend (provides API endpoints for specific tasks like applying dynamic YAML, managing VM processes).
- **Kubernetes Interaction**:
  - **Host CLI from Frontend**: `kubectl` commands executed via `ddClient.extension.host.cli.exec()` are the primary method for frontend services (e.g., `loadBalancerService.ts`, `githubTemplateService.ts`, `kubernetes.ts`) to interact with Kubernetes for fetching resources, status checks, and applying URL-based manifests. This ensures reliability by using the host's Kubernetes context.
  - **VM Backend `kubectl`**: The Go backend service uses its embedded `kubectl` for operations it orchestrates (e.g., via `/apply-yaml` for dynamically generated YAML content).
- **Visualization**: D3.js or similar for resource visualization (Planned)
- **State Management**: React Hooks (Context API for simpler shared state if needed, no global Redux)

### Key Components

1. **Template Engine**
   - Manages predefined resource templates
   - Handles variable substitution
   - Validates template compatibility

2. **Resource Manager**
   - Handles CRUD operations for Kubernetes resources
   - Tracks resource status and relationships
   - Provides error handling and recovery

3. **Workflow Engine**
   - Manages multi-step processes
   - Tracks completion status
   - Handles dependencies between steps

4. **Visualization System**
   - Renders resource relationships
   - Displays traffic flow
   - Shows resource status

### Data Models

1. **Template Model**
   ```typescript
   interface Template {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     description: string;
     useCase: UseCase;
     resources: KubernetesResource[];
     dependencies: Dependency[];
     instructions: Instruction[];
   }
   ```

2. **Tutorial Model**
   ```typescript
   interface Tutorial {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     description: string;
     steps: TutorialStep[];
     estimatedTime: number;
     difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
   }
   ```

3. **Resource Model**
   ```typescript
   interface KubernetesResource {
     kind: string;
     apiVersion: string;
     metadata: {
       name: string;
       namespace: string;
     };
     spec: any;
     status?: any;
   }
   ```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Kubernetes API changes | High | Medium | Use stable API versions, implement version detection |
| Envoy Gateway version compatibility | High | Medium | Test with multiple versions, implement version checks |
| Performance issues with large clusters | Medium | Low | Implement pagination and lazy loading |
| User experience complexity | Medium | Medium | Conduct early user testing, implement progressive disclosure |
| Docker Desktop API limitations | Was High, Now Low | Low | VM Service Backend architecture with strategic use of `host.cli.exec()` from frontend services has largely mitigated these. Kubernetes interactions from the VM backend still require careful handling of API endpoint (e.g., `host.docker.internal` vs `127.0.0.1`). |

## Success Criteria

1. Users can deploy and test all use cases with minimal manual steps
2. Extension provides clear feedback on resource status
3. Users can understand Gateway API concepts through the UI
4. Extension handles errors gracefully with helpful messages
5. All use cases work consistently across supported platforms

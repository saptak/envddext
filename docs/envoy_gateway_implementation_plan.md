- [ ] Add UI elements in HTTPRoute forms (or via policies) to configure request timeouts and backend timeouts.
- [ ] Ensure the configuration is translated to the appropriate Envoy Gateway Custom Resource or `EnvoyPatchPolicy`.
- **Enables PRD Use Case**: "Resilience Policies: Timeouts & Retries" (Timeouts part).
- **Testable Outcome**: Users can define and apply timeout policies to their routes.

### Task 11.5: Implement Retry Policy Configuration UI (2-3 days)
- [ ] Add UI elements in HTTPRoute forms (or via policies) to configure retry attempts, retry-on conditions (e.g., 5xx errors, connection failure), and per-try timeouts.
- [ ] Ensure configuration translates to appropriate Envoy Gateway Custom Resource or `EnvoyPatchPolicy`.
- **Enables PRD Use Case**: "Resilience Policies: Timeouts & Retries" (Retries part).
- **Testable Outcome**: Users can define and apply retry policies to their routes.

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material-UI, Docker Extension SDK
- **Backend**: Go 1.19+ HTTP server (running in Docker Desktop VM)
- **Build Tools**: Node.js, npm, craco, Docker

### Key Components
- **UI Components**:
  - `AppWithGitHubTemplates.tsx`: Main application component with tabbed interface
  - `GatewayCreationForm.tsx`, `HTTPRouteForm.tsx`: Forms for resource creation
  - `LoadBalancerManager.tsx`: UI for MetalLB status and configuration
  - `HTTPClientComponent.tsx`: UI for HTTP testing
  - `ProxyManagerComponent.tsx`: UI for kubectl proxy management
  - Various status display and list components
- **Services**:
  - `kubernetes.ts`: Helper functions for Kubernetes API interactions (mix of host CLI and backend calls)
  - `loadBalancerService.ts`: Logic for MetalLB status checking and configuration
  - `githubTemplateService.ts`: Fetches and applies templates from GitHub (uses host CLI)
  - `kubectlProxyService.ts`: Manages kubectl proxy lifecycle via backend API
- **Backend (Go)**:
  - `main.go`: HTTP server with API endpoints for:
    - Resource creation (`/create-gateway`, `/create-httproute`)
    - Applying generic YAML (`/apply-yaml` - used by LoadBalancer service)
    - Applying templates from URLs (`/apply-template` - less used now, frontend prefers host CLI)
    - Kubectl proxy management (`/start-proxy`, `/stop-proxy`, `/proxy-status`)
    - Generic kubectl command execution (`/kubectl` - used for specific backend tasks)
  - YAML generation and `kubectl` command execution logic.

### Data Models

#### Template
```typescript
interface Template {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  yamlUrl: string; // URL to the raw YAML file on GitHub
  // Potentially add parameters or required inputs if templates become more complex
}
```

#### Tutorial
```typescript
interface Tutorial {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  steps: Array<{
    title: string;
    instructions: string;
    action?: () => Promise<void>; // Action to perform for this step
    validation?: () => Promise<boolean>; // Check if step is completed
  }>;
}
```

#### KubernetesResource
```typescript
// Generic structure, specific types for Gateway, HTTPRoute etc. exist in ui/src/types
interface KubernetesResource {
  apiVersion: string;
  kind: string;
  metadata: {
    name: string;
    namespace?: string;
    [key: string]: any; // Other metadata fields
  };
  spec: {
    [key: string]: any; // Spec fields vary by resource
  };
  status?: {
    [key: string]: any; // Status fields
  };
}
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- **Complexity of Gateway API**: Provide clear explanations and guided workflows
  - Mitigation: Interactive tutorials, pre-configured templates, simplified forms.
- **Envoy Gateway Evolution**: API changes in Envoy Gateway or Gateway API spec
  - Mitigation: Target stable API versions, plan for adaptable UI components.
- **User Kubernetes Knowledge**: Users may have varying levels of Kubernetes expertise
  - Mitigation: Offer both simple (template-based) and advanced (form/YAML-based) configuration paths.
- **Docker Desktop Extension SDK Limitations**: **Largely mitigated by VM service backend architecture.** Host CLI for K8s interactions further improves reliability.
  - Mitigation: VM service backend handles complex operations. Host CLI used for direct K8s comms from frontend services.

## Success Criteria
- High completion rate for "Basic HTTP Routing" and "TLS Termination" tutorials
- Positive user feedback on ease of use and time to value
- Increased engagement with advanced features (traffic splitting, rate limiting)
- Extension stability with low error rates during common operations
- Successful demonstration of all PRD use cases through the UI.

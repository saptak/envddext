- **Envoy Gateway Evolution**: API changes in Envoy Gateway or Gateway API spec
  - Mitigation: Target stable API versions, plan for adaptable UI components.
- **User Kubernetes Knowledge**: Users may have varying levels of Kubernetes expertise
  - Mitigation: Offer both simple (template-based) and advanced (form/YAML-based) configuration paths.
- **Docker Desktop Extension SDK Limitations**: **Largely mitigated by VM service backend architecture.** Host CLI for K8s interactions further improves reliability.
  - Mitigation: VM service backend handles complex operations. Host CLI used for direct K8s comms from frontend services.

## Success Criteria
- High completion rate for "Basic HTTP Routing" and "TLS Termination" tutorials

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Kubernetes API changes | High | Medium | Use stable API versions, implement version detection |
| Envoy Gateway version compatibility | High | Medium | Test with multiple versions, implement version checks |
| Performance issues with large clusters | Medium | Low | Implement pagination and lazy loading |
| User experience complexity | Medium | Medium | Conduct early user testing, implement progressive disclosure |
| Docker Desktop API limitations | High | Low | Identify limitations early, design around constraints |

## Success Criteria

1. Users can deploy and test all use cases with minimal manual steps
2. Extension provides clear feedback on resource status
3. Users can understand Gateway API concepts through the UI
4. Extension handles errors gracefully with helpful messages
5. All use cases work consistently across supported platforms

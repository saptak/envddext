## Demo 1: Your First Gateway

**What you'll learn**: Basic gateway concepts, simple HTTP routing, and testing

### Understanding the Basics

Before diving into configuration, let's understand the key components:

* **Gateway**: The entry point that listens for incoming traffic
* **HTTPRoute**: Rules that determine how requests are routed to services
* **Backend Service**: Your application that serves requests

Think of it like a reception desk at a building: the Gateway is the desk, HTTPRoutes are the directory rules, and backend services are the actual offices.

### Step 1.1: Deploy a Sample Application

We'll start with a simple echo service that returns information about incoming requests.

1. **Open the Extension**:
   * Navigate to the **Templates** tab
   * This tab contains pre-configured examples for quick setup

2. **Deploy the Echo Service**:
   * Find the **"Echo Service - Basic HTTP"** template
   * Click **"Apply Template"**
   * This deploys a simple service that echoes back request information

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   * Watch the notification for deployment status
   * The echo service will be deployed to the `demo` namespace

**What happened?** You just deployed a simple web service that will help us test our gateway configuration. The echo service responds with details about incoming requests, making it perfect for learning.

### Step 1.2: Create Your First Gateway

A Gateway defines how external traffic enters your cluster.

1. **Navigate to Gateway Management**:
   * Click the **"Gateway Management"** tab
   * This is where you configure entry points for your traffic

2. **Check Prerequisites**:
   * Look at the **LoadBalancer Configuration** section
   * If it shows "NOT CONFIGURED", we'll fix this in Demo 3
   * For now, we can still create the Gateway

3. **Create the Gateway**:
   * Click **"+ Create Gateway"**
   * **Gateway Name**: `my-first-gateway`
   * **Namespace**: `demo`
   * **Gateway Class**: `envoy-gateway`

4. **Configure the Listener**:
   * **Listener Name**: `http`
   * **Port**: `80`
   * **Protocol**: `HTTP`
   * **Hostname**: Leave empty (accepts all hostnames)

5. **Set Route Permissions**:
   * **Allowed Routes From**: `Same` (routes from same namespace)
   * Click **"Create Gateway"**

**What happened?** You created a gateway that listens on port 80 for HTTP traffic. It's ready to accept routing rules from the same namespace.

### Step 1.3: Create Your First Route

HTTPRoutes define how requests are matched and forwarded to services.

1. **Navigate to HTTPRoute Management**:
   * Click the **"HTTPRoute Management"** tab

2. **Create the Route**:
   * Click **"+ Create HTTPRoute"**
   * **Route Name**: `echo-route`
   * **Namespace**: `demo`
   * **Parent Gateway**: Select `my-first-gateway`

3. **Configure Routing Rules**:
   * **Hostname**: `echo.local` (we'll use this for testing)
   * **Path Type**: `PathPrefix`
   * **Path Value**: `/` (matches all paths)
   * **HTTP Method**: `GET`
   * **Backend Service**: `echo-service`
   * **Port**: `80`
   * **Weight**: `100`

4. **Create the Route**:
   * Click **"Create HTTPRoute"**

**What happened?** You created a routing rule that sends all GET requests to `echo.local` to your echo service.

### Step 1.4: Test Your Setup

Now let's test the gateway you just created.

1. **Navigate to Testing & Proxy**:
   * Click the **"Testing & Proxy"** tab
   * This tab includes enhanced proxy reliability features (v0.8.1)

2. **Start the Proxy** (Enhanced Reliability):
   * Click **"Start Proxy"** in the Proxy Manager section
   * **New in v0.8.1**: Automatic kubeconfig detection and enhanced error handling
   * Wait for status to show "Running"

3. **Get Gateway Information**:
   * Return to **Gateway Management** tab
   * Note the **External IP** of your gateway (if LoadBalancer is configured)
   * If no external IP, we'll use the proxy for testing

4. **Test with HTTP Client**:
   * Return to **Testing & Proxy** tab
   * **URL**: `http://echo.local/` (add Host header)
   * **Method**: `GET`
   * **Headers**: Add `Host: echo.local`
   * Click **"Send Request"**

5. **Examine the Response**:
   * You should see JSON containing request details
   * Notice headers added by the gateway (like `x-envoy-*`)

**What happened?** Your first request traveled through the gateway to your service! The echo service returned details about the request, showing that routing worked correctly.

### Key Concepts Learned

* **Gateway**: Entry point for external traffic
* **HTTPRoute**: Routing rules that match requests to services
* **Path Matching**: How URLs are matched to routes
* **Backend References**: How routes connect to services

### Next Steps

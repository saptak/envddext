# Envoy Gateway Extension PRD: Enhanced User Experience

## Document Information
- **Document Title**: Envoy Gateway Extension Enhancement PRD
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: May 19, 2023
- **Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

The Envoy Gateway Extension for Docker Desktop provides a user interface for managing Envoy Gateway resources in a local Kubernetes cluster. While the extension currently offers basic functionality for viewing Gateway and Route resources, it lacks guided workflows for new users to quickly experience the benefits of Envoy Gateway.

This PRD outlines enhancements to the extension that will enable users to easily try common Envoy Gateway use cases directly from the Docker Desktop interface, significantly improving the onboarding experience and reducing the time to value.

## Background

Envoy Gateway is a powerful API Gateway built on Envoy Proxy and the Kubernetes Gateway API. However, getting started with Envoy Gateway requires knowledge of Kubernetes, Gateway API resources, and YAML configuration. This creates a high barrier to entry for new users who want to evaluate Envoy Gateway's capabilities.

The current Docker Desktop extension allows users to install Envoy Gateway and view resources but doesn't provide guided workflows or templates for common use cases.

## Goals

1. Reduce the time to value for new Envoy Gateway users
2. Provide guided workflows for common API Gateway use cases
3. Educate users on Envoy Gateway capabilities through interactive examples
4. Increase adoption of Envoy Gateway through an improved user experience
5. Showcase the power of Docker Desktop extensions for Kubernetes tooling

## Non-Goals

1. Replacing comprehensive documentation or tutorials
2. Supporting all possible Envoy Gateway configurations
3. Providing production deployment configurations
4. Creating a full management UI for all Envoy Gateway features

## User Personas

### Persona 1: Developer Evaluating API Gateway Solutions
- Wants to quickly understand Envoy Gateway capabilities
- Has limited Kubernetes experience
- Needs to see working examples with minimal setup

### Persona 2: DevOps Engineer
- Familiar with Kubernetes
- Wants to test specific Gateway configurations locally
- Needs to validate configurations before production deployment

### Persona 3: Platform Engineer
- Experienced with Kubernetes and networking
- Wants to evaluate Envoy Gateway for platform integration
- Needs to understand performance and feature set

## Requirements

## User Experience

### Quick Start Flow
1. User opens the Envoy Gateway extension
2. User selects "Quick Start" section
3. User chooses a use case template
4. Extension deploys necessary resources
5. Extension provides a success message with next steps
6. User can interact with the deployed example

### Tutorial Flow
1. User selects a tutorial from the list
2. Extension presents step-by-step instructions
3. Each step includes explanations and actions
4. User completes actions and proceeds to next step
5. Extension validates completion of each step
6. User completes the tutorial with a working example

### Configuration Flow
1. User selects "Create Resource" option
2. User chooses resource type (Gateway, HTTPRoute, etc.)
3. User fills out form with configuration options
4. Extension generates and previews YAML
5. User can edit YAML if needed
6. User applies configuration to cluster
7. Extension shows deployment status and resource details

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption Metrics**
   - Number of extension installations
   - Frequency of extension usage
   - Completion rate of tutorials

2. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Time to complete first use case
   - Number of errors encountered
   - User satisfaction ratings

3. **Technical Metrics**
   - Resource deployment success rate
   - Performance of deployed examples
   - Extension stability

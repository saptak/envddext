# Envoy Gateway Extension PRD: Enhanced User Experience

## Document Information
- **Document Title**: Envoy Gateway Extension Enhancement PRD
- **Version**: 1.2
- **Date**: June 12, 2025
- **Status**: v0.9.1 Implementation Complete

## Executive Summary

The Envoy Gateway Extension for Docker Desktop provides a comprehensive user interface for managing Envoy Gateway resources in a local Kubernetes cluster. The extension now offers full functionality for creating and managing Gateway and HTTPRoute resources, guided templates for common use cases, and integrated testing tools.

This PRD outlines the completed enhancements to the extension that enable users to easily try common Envoy Gateway use cases directly from the Docker Desktop interface, significantly improving the onboarding experience and reducing the time to value.

## Background

Envoy Gateway is a powerful API Gateway built on Envoy Proxy and the Kubernetes Gateway API. However, getting started with Envoy Gateway requires knowledge of Kubernetes, Gateway API resources, and YAML configuration. This creates a high barrier to entry for new users who want to evaluate Envoy Gateway's capabilities.

The Docker Desktop extension now provides comprehensive functionality including Envoy Gateway installation, resource creation and management, guided workflows, templates for common use cases, integrated testing tools with reliable kubectl proxy management, synthetic traffic generation with performance testing capabilities, comprehensive security policy management with enterprise-grade authentication and access control features, and advanced rate limiting with sophisticated testing tools.

## Goals ✅ COMPLETED

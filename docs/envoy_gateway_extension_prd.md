# Envoy Gateway Extension PRD: Enhanced User Experience

## Document Information
- **Document Title**: Envoy Gateway Extension Enhancement PRD
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: June 11, 2025
- **Status**: Implementation Complete

## Executive Summary

The Envoy Gateway Extension for Docker Desktop provides a comprehensive user interface for managing Envoy Gateway resources in a local Kubernetes cluster. The extension now offers full functionality for creating and managing Gateway and HTTPRoute resources, guided templates for common use cases, and integrated testing tools.

This PRD outlines the completed enhancements to the extension that enable users to easily try common Envoy Gateway use cases directly from the Docker Desktop interface, significantly improving the onboarding experience and reducing the time to value.

## Background

Envoy Gateway is a powerful API Gateway built on Envoy Proxy and the Kubernetes Gateway API. However, getting started with Envoy Gateway requires knowledge of Kubernetes, Gateway API resources, and YAML configuration. This creates a high barrier to entry for new users who want to evaluate Envoy Gateway's capabilities.

The Docker Desktop extension now provides comprehensive functionality including Envoy Gateway installation, resource creation and management, guided workflows, templates for common use cases, and integrated testing tools.

## Goals âœ… COMPLETED

1. âœ… Reduce the time to value for new Envoy Gateway users
2. âœ… Provide guided workflows for common API Gateway use cases
3. âœ… Educate users on Envoy Gateway capabilities through interactive examples
4. âœ… Increase adoption of Envoy Gateway through an improved user experience


## Non-Goals

1. Replacing comprehensive documentation or tutorials
2. Supporting all possible Envoy Gateway configurations
3. Providing production deployment configurations
4. Creating a full management UI for all Envoy Gateway features

### Use Cases to Support

1. **Flexible HTTP Routing & Request Matching**
   - Deploy simple web applications and expose them via Gateways.
   - Configure `HTTPRoute` resources with rules based on:
     - URL Paths (prefix, exact, regular expression).
     - Hostnames.
     - HTTP Headers (presence, exact match, regular expression).
     - Query Parameters (exact match).
   - Test routing with sample requests using the built-in HTTP client.

2. **TLS Termination**
   - Secure Gateway listeners with HTTPS.
   - Configure TLS termination using Kubernetes Secrets containing certificates and keys.
   - Verify secure connections to backend services.
   - (Future: Guide users on integrating with `cert-manager` for automated certificate provisioning).

3. **Traffic Splitting (Canary & Blue/Green)**
   - Deploy multiple versions of an application.
   - Configure weighted routing in `HTTPRoute` to distribute traffic between different backend service versions.
   - Test and visualize traffic distribution.

4. **Resilience Policies: Timeouts & Retries**
   - Configure request timeouts for Gateway listeners or specific routes.
   - Implement retry policies for failed requests to backend services (e.g., on 5xx errors or connection failures for idempotent requests).
   - Test timeout and retry behaviors.

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configure global and per-route rate limits to protect backend services.
   - Test rate limiting behavior under load.
   - (Future: Visualize rate limit metrics).

6. **Security Policy: JWT Authentication**
   - Configure JWT validation for specific routes using Envoy Gateway's `SecurityPolicy` or similar mechanisms.
   - Define JWT providers, issuers, and JWKS URIs.
   - Test API access with valid and invalid JWTs.
   - (Future: Visualize authentication flow).

7. **Security Policy: Basic Authentication**
   - Protect routes with basic username/password authentication.
   - Manage credentials via Kubernetes Secrets.
   - Test access with and without credentials.

8. **Security Policy: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
   - Configure CORS policies at the Gateway or Route level.
   - Define allowed origins, methods, headers, and other CORS parameters.
   - Enable secure cross-domain requests from web applications.

9. **Security Policy: IP-based Access Control**
   - Implement IP allow-lists or deny-lists for specific routes or listeners.
   - Restrict access based on source IP addresses or CIDR ranges.

10. **Security Policy: Mutual TLS (mTLS) Client Authentication**
    - Configure Gateway listeners to require client certificates for mTLS.
    - Manage client CA certificates for validation.
    - Secure service-to-service or B2B communication requiring strong client authentication.

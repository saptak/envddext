# Envoy Gateway Extension v0.12.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: June 14, 2025  
**Codename**: "Enhanced HTTP Client Experience"

## üöÄ Major HTTP Client Improvements

### ‚ö° Enhanced Headers Management

#### Professional Headers Interface
- **Headers Accordion Section**: Dedicated headers management with clear visual hierarchy
- **Dynamic Header Count**: Real-time indicator showing number of enabled headers
- **Toggle Controls**: Individual enable/disable switches for each header pair
- **Add/Remove Functionality**: Easy header management with "Add Header" button and delete controls
- **Visual Status**: Disabled styling when headers are toggled off for clear visual feedback

#### Improved User Experience
- **Default Expanded**: Headers section opens by default for immediate access
- **Clean Material-UI Design**: Professional accordion interface matching overall extension design
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Optimal layout with toggle (1 col) + key (5 cols) + value (5 cols) + delete (1 col)
- **Smart Field Management**: Header fields disabled when toggled off to prevent confusion

#### Enhanced Request Management
- **Request Body Section**: Dynamic body editor that appears only for POST/PUT/PATCH methods
- **Integrated with JWT**: JWT authentication headers automatically managed alongside custom headers
- **HTTPS Testing**: Headers interface works seamlessly with TLS options for secure testing
- **History Integration**: Headers preserved in request history for easy replay

## üé® User Interface Enhancements

### Material-UI Integration
- **Consistent Design**: Headers interface matches the existing accordion patterns (TLS, JWT)
- **Professional Icons**: AddIcon for adding headers, ClearIcon for removing headers
- **Chip Indicators**: Header count displayed in a primary-colored chip for clear visibility
- **Responsive Design**: Headers interface adapts to different screen sizes

### Workflow Improvements
- **Logical Flow**: Headers positioned before JWT authentication in the request configuration
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic headers first, then advanced options (JWT, TLS)
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Each section clearly defined with appropriate spacing and styling
- **Intuitive Controls**: Toggle switches and buttons positioned for natural workflow

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
- **HTTPClient Enhancement**: Added comprehensive headers management to existing component
- **State Management**: Headers stored as `HeaderPair[]` with key, value, and enabled properties
- **Event Handlers**: Dedicated handlers for header changes, additions, and removals
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with existing `HeaderPair` interface

### Integration Points
- **JWT Authentication**: Headers interface works alongside JWT configuration
- **TLS Options**: Compatible with HTTPS testing and certificate management
- **Request History**: Headers preserved in request/response history
- **cURL Generation**: Headers properly included in generated cURL commands

### Code Quality
- **Existing Patterns**: Follows established component patterns and styling
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal impact on existing performance optimizations
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of header validation and state management
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live metrics during traffic splitting tests with immediate feedback on configuration effectiveness

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Backend Architecture
- **Robust API Design**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive error handling and proper HTTP status codes
- **Concurrent Processing**: Efficient Go routine management with proper resource cleanup and timeout handling
- **Thread-safe Metrics**: Concurrent metrics collection using sync.RWMutex for accurate real-time data
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of HTTP clients, timers, and background processes

### Frontend Architecture  
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular TrafficGenerator and TrafficVisualization components for maintainability
- **State Management**: Efficient React state management with proper useEffect cleanup and memory management
- **Real-time Updates**: 2-second refresh intervals for live metrics with proper component lifecycle handling
- **TypeScript Integration**: Comprehensive type definitions for traffic configurations and metrics data

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Traffic Testing Reliability
- **Connection Management**: Proper HTTP client timeout and connection pooling for stable traffic generation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and categorization with user-friendly error messages  
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of background processes and proper test lifecycle management
- **UI Synchronization**: Accurate start/stop state management with proper loading indicators

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized SVG chart rendering with proper data point limiting for smooth performance
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of metrics history and background intervals to prevent memory leaks
- **Network Efficiency**: Optimized API calls with proper error retry logic and timeout handling
- **UI Responsiveness**: Smooth interactions with proper loading states and feedback mechanisms

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged with no breaking changes
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Existing HTTP Testing and Traffic Splitting features now include advanced traffic generation
- **No Configuration Required**: New features are automatically available in existing Testing & Proxy and Traffic Splitting tabs
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Users can adopt traffic generation features gradually without disrupting existing workflows

### New Dependencies
- **No External Libraries**: All visualization and traffic generation implemented with existing dependencies
- **Backend Extensions**: Enhanced Go backend with additional API endpoints using existing libraries
- **Frontend Integration**: New components built with existing Material-UI and React architecture
- **Zero Configuration**: No additional setup required beyond normal extension installation

## üìã Known Limitations

### Traffic Generation Scope
- **HTTP/HTTPS Only**: Currently supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols (no TCP, UDP, or gRPC)
- **Basic Load Patterns**: Linear RPS patterns (no burst or complex load curve configurations yet)
- **Single Target**: One target URL per test session (no multi-endpoint load testing)
- **Local Testing**: Optimized for local development and testing scenarios

### Visualization Features
- **Basic Charts**: Simple response time and RPS charts (no advanced analytics or drill-down capabilities)
- **Limited History**: Maintains last 50 data points per session (no persistent historical storage)
- **Real-time Only**: Live metrics during test execution (no post-test analysis or reporting)
- **Chart Export**: No chart export or sharing capabilities yet

## üîÆ What's Next

### Iteration 8: Advanced Resource Management  
- **Resource Editing**: Update existing Gateway and HTTPRoute configurations
- **Resource Cloning**: Duplicate and modify existing resources for iterative development
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-resource management capabilities for efficient workflows
- **Resource Templates**: Save and reuse custom configurations for team standardization

### Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Load Patterns**: Support for burst traffic, ramp-up/down patterns, and complex load curves
- **Multi-endpoint Testing**: Concurrent testing of multiple endpoints with correlation analysis
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish and compare against performance baselines with alerting
- **Test Automation**: Scheduled and automated traffic testing with CI/CD integration

## üôè Acknowledgments

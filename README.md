All HTTPRoute creation, Gateway management, and LoadBalancer features remain stable and enhanced.

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (Iteration 1-5)

#### VM Service Backend Architecture (Iteration 5 ‚úÖ)
- **Go Backend Service**: Complete backend rewrite with HTTP API server
- **File System Access**: Full `/tmp/` access and temporary file operations (by backend service)
- **Process Management**: Proper kubectl proxy lifecycle with PID tracking (by backend service)
- **Gateway/HTTPRoute Creation**: Fully functional resource creation. Enhanced reliability due to improved backend kubeconfig handling, clearer frontend error propagation, and correct frontend interpretation of backend success responses (resolving misleading UI errors for successful or idempotent operations).
- **Template Application**: Reliable GitHub template deployment using the **host's `kubectl`** for applying templates from URLs.
- **LoadBalancer Management**: Robust MetalLB integration, including installation (using host CLI for initial manifest with `--validate=false`), configuration (IP range detection, dynamic IPAddressPool/L2Advertisement via backend `/apply-yaml`), and highly accurate real-time status display (using host CLI for all K8s checks). UI for status reporting and MetalLB configuration dialogs significantly improved for clarity and error feedback, resolving issues related to "AddressNotAssigned" Gateways.
- **Docker Desktop Integration**: VM service with Unix socket communication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting from backend to frontend. Specific UI feedback improvements in Gateway creation and LoadBalancer configuration dialogs, including fixing misleading UI error messages for operations that succeeded.

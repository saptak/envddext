# Envoy Gateway Docker Desktop Extension - FAQ

## Getting Started

### I'm new to API gateways. Is this for me?

Absolutely! This extension was designed specifically for developers who want API gateway capabilities without the complexity. You don't need any prior experience with Kubernetes, YAML, or networking concepts. The visual interface guides you through everything.

### What will I be able to do in the first 5 minutes?

- Install and configure Envoy Gateway
- Create basic Gateway resources with visual forms
- Set up HTTP routing rules (HTTPRoutes) with path matching and validation
- Deploy a working example application from templates
- Test your routes with the built-in HTTP client
- See real-time status of your Gateways and routes
- Access everything from responsive tabs that work on any screen size

### I'm already using Kubernetes tools. Why switch?

You don't have to switch! This extension works alongside your existing tools. It's perfect for:
- **Rapid prototyping**: Test basic HTTP routing without writing YAML
- **Team onboarding**: Get new developers productive with Gateway basics immediately  
- **Local development**: Consistent basic gateway environment for all team members
- **Learning**: Understand how Gateway and HTTPRoute configurations work before writing them manually

### Do I need to know Kubernetes?

Not at all. The extension handles all Kubernetes complexity behind the scenes. You work with simple forms and get immediate visual feedback. However, if you do know Kubernetes, you can still view and edit the generated YAML when needed.

## Installation and Setup

### Is installation complicated?

Not at all! It's literally three clicks:
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Extensions â†’ Search "Envoy Gateway"
3. Click Install

The extension handles everything else automatically.

### What do I need before installing?

Just Docker Desktop with Kubernetes turned on. If you can run containers, you're ready to go. The extension includes everything else you need.

### Will this mess up my existing Docker setup?

No. The extension creates its own resources and doesn't interfere with your existing containers or configurations. You can uninstall it cleanly anytime.

### I clicked install, now what?

Open the extension and click "Install Envoy Gateway" if prompted. Then click "Quick Start" to deploy your first working example. You'll have a running API gateway in under 2 minutes.

## Using the Extension

### What's the fastest way to see results?

Click "Quick Start" and choose "Basic HTTP" template. You'll have a working Gateway and HTTPRoute with a test service running in 30 seconds. Then use the built-in HTTP client to test it immediately.

### I don't want to use templates. Can I create custom gateways?

Of course! Go to "Gateway Management" and click "Create New Gateway". Fill out the simple form for basic Gateway configuration - no YAML required. Then create HTTPRoutes to define your routing rules using the "HTTPRoute Management" tab. The extension shows you exactly what it's creating, validates everything in real-time, clears validation errors when you fix them, and automatically closes forms after successful creation.

### How do I know if my gateway is working?

The extension shows you everything visually:
- Green checkmarks for healthy Gateways and HTTPRoutes
- Red warnings for problems (with solutions)
- Real-time status updates for all resources
- Built-in testing so you can verify routing functionality immediately

### What if I want to test my routes?

No need for external tools! The extension includes a full HTTP client:
- Test any endpoint with any HTTP method
- See beautifully formatted responses  
- Save requests to replay later
- Generate cURL commands to share with teammates

### Can I route traffic to my own applications?

Absolutely! Create HTTPRoutes that point to your existing Kubernetes services. The extension helps you configure:
- Path-based routing (exact paths, prefixes, regex)
- Header and query parameter matching
- Backend service selection and weighting
- Basic timeout configuration
All through visual forms - no YAML required.

### What routing features are currently supported?

The extension currently supports HTTP routing with:
- **Path matching**: Exact, PathPrefix, and RegularExpression
- **Header matching**: Exact values and presence checks
- **Query parameter matching**: Exact values
- **Backend services**: Multiple backends with traffic weighting
- **Timeouts**: Request and backend timeout configuration
- **Gateway integration**: Automatic parent Gateway validation

### What's not supported yet?

Currently, the extension focuses on basic Gateway and HTTPRoute management. Not yet supported:
- **Policy management**: Security policies, rate limiting, authentication
- **Resource editing**: You can create and delete but not edit existing resources
- **Advanced protocols**: TCP, UDP, or gRPC routing (HTTP only)
- **TLS configuration**: Beyond basic listener setup
- **Advanced Envoy features**: EnvoyProxy custom resources or patches

## Common Questions

### Something's not working. What do I check first?

Look at the status indicators in the extension - they'll tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. Most issues are solved by:

1. Making sure Kubernetes is running in Docker Desktop
2. Clicking "Configure LoadBalancer" if prompted
3. Waiting a minute for services to start up
4. Using the "Refresh Resources" button

### My gateway has no IP address

This means you need to set up the LoadBalancer. The extension will show you a "Configure LoadBalancer" button when this happens. Click it and follow the prompts - it's completely automated.

### I can't reach my services from outside

First, check that your gateway has an IP address (green status). Then make sure you're using the right URL format: `http://[gateway-ip]/your-path`. The HTTP client in the extension shows you exactly what URLs to use.

### Nothing happens when I click buttons

This usually means Docker Desktop needs more memory. Try:
1. Increase Docker Desktop memory to 6GB or more
2. Restart Docker Desktop
3. Wait for Kubernetes to be fully ready (green indicator)

### The extension seems slow or unresponsive

The extension is doing real Kubernetes operations, which can take a moment. Look for loading indicators and status messages. If it's consistently slow, try restarting Docker Desktop.

### The tabs don't fit on my screen

The extension now includes responsive design with scrollable tabs. When there are too many tabs for your screen width, you'll see left/right arrow buttons to scroll through them. This works on mobile devices and narrow windows automatically.

## What Else Can I Do?

### Can I use this for real projects?

The extension is perfect for basic HTTP routing scenarios in development and learning environments. For production use:

- **Gateway and HTTPRoute configurations** you create are standard Kubernetes resources
- **Export generated YAML** for production deployment
- **Learn routing patterns** you can apply in any Kubernetes environment
- **Prototype basic configurations** before production deployment

However, production environments typically need additional features not yet supported like security policies, rate limiting, and advanced traffic management.

### What if I need to modify existing resources?

Currently, the extension supports creating and deleting resources but not editing them. To modify existing Gateways or HTTPRoutes:

- Delete the existing resource and recreate it with new settings
- Edit the YAML directly using kubectl or other Kubernetes tools
- Use the extension to understand the configuration structure, then manage updates externally

Resource editing is planned for future releases.

### Can my team use this together?

Yes! Teams find this extension valuable for:

- **Consistent basic routing environments** across all team members
- **New team member onboarding** with Gateway API basics
- **Shared learning** about Gateway and HTTPRoute configurations
- **Local development standardization** for basic HTTP scenarios

However, for complex production scenarios requiring policies and advanced features, teams typically need additional tools.

### What about advanced gateway features?

The extension currently focuses on foundational Gateway and HTTPRoute management. For advanced features like:

- **Security policies** (JWT, authentication, authorization)
- **Rate limiting** and traffic policies
- **Advanced TLS configuration**
- **Protocol routing** beyond HTTP
- **EnvoyProxy custom resources**

You'll need to use kubectl, Helm charts, or other Kubernetes tools. These features are planned for future extension releases.

### When should I use other tools instead?

Consider using kubectl, Helm, or other tools when you need:

- **Policy management**: Security, rate limiting, or traffic policies
- **Resource editing**: Modifying existing configurations
- **Production deployments**: Complex multi-environment scenarios
- **Advanced protocols**: TCP, UDP, or gRPC routing
- **Complex TLS scenarios**: Certificate management and rotation

The extension excels at basic HTTP routing scenarios and learning Gateway API concepts.
